Reagan: George Washington has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in our history President Reagan, on behalf of our nation, I thank you for the wonderful things that you have done for America President Barack Obama's first act as President is a prayer Obama asks the nation to bow their heads and thank God for the peace that yields this day A nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the exercise of free will unhampered by America today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil, a place we cannot help but love But have we changed as a nation even in our time? Are we enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the President Barack Obama's first State of the Union address was delivered on January 20 Obama said the US has a "purpose today" to make the nation "kinder" "We have more will than wallet, but will is what we need," Obama says "We will make the hard choices, looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently," he says "I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others, a new activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done" "We will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, My government to become involved The old ideas are new again because they're not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in We need a new engagement Vietnam war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago, and surely the statute of limitation has been reached The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory A new President Obama: "We offer new engagement and a renewed vow: We will stay strong to protect the peace" Obama: America says something, America means it, whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow "We will continue the new closeness with the Soviet Union, consistent both with our security and with progress," he said "Hope is good, and so is strength and vigilance," he added A President is neither prince nor pope, and I don't seek a window on men's souls I yearn for a greater tolerance, and easygoingness about each other's attitudes and way of life There are few clear areas "I see history as a book with many pages, and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning," Obama says "If our flaws are endless, God's love is truly boundless," he adds
My fellow citizens, today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal This ceremony is held in the depth of winter, but by the words we speak and the faces we show the world, we force the spring, a spring reborn in the President Barack Obama sworn in as president of the United States Obama: "The urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our time" President Obama: "We have not made change our friend, we have drifted" "We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but we have not done so," he says "We must bring to our "This is our time Let us embrace it," Obama says "There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America" "A new season of American renewal has begun," he says "We must provide for our Nation the way a family provides for its children" "To renew America, we must revitalize our democracy" "It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing" "Americans deserve better," Obama says "To renew America, we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home" "There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic," he says The new world is more free but less stable Communism's collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers Clearly, America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make President Obama: "You have changed the face of Congress, the Presidency, and the political process itself" "I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of service" "We need each other, and we must care for one another," Obama says "Let us begin anew with energy and hope, with faith and discipline," he says " now, each in our own way and with God's help, we must answer the call Thank you, and God bless you all"
President Obama: "Let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century" "It is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century, in a new Americans produced a great middle class and security in old age We built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all We split the atom and explored the heavens We invented the computer and the microchip President Barack Obama has marked his fourth year in office with a speech to the nation Obama: "A free people must now choose to shape the forces of the information age and the global society" The US problem, and Government is not the solution We--; the American people--; we are the solution We need a new Government for a new century, humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for "We need a new sense of responsibility for a new century," Obama says "For any one of us to succeed, we must succeed as one America," he says New wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices Prejudice and contempt cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction are no different These forces have nearly destroyed our Nation in the past They plague us still President Barack Obama marks the 100th anniversary of the US Declaration of Independence Obama: "Can we hope not just to follow but even to surpass the achievements of the 20th century" "With a new vision of Government, a new sense of responsibility, and a new spirit of community, we will sustain America's journey," Obama says "Education will be every citizen's most prized possession," he adds "We will stand mighty for peace and freedom and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction," Obama says "Our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons," he adds "The world's "Let us build that America," Obama says "A nation ever moving forward toward realizing the full potential of all its citizens" "In this land of new promise, we will have reformed our politics," he says President Barack Obama: "By our dreams and labors, we will redeem the promise of America in the 21st century" Obama: America demands and deserves big things from us, and nothing big ever came from being small "The journey of our America must go on," Obama writes "Let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our history" "From the height of this place and the summit of this century, let us go forth May God strengthen our hands for the good work ahead," he said
"I present to you a summary of the principles which will govern me in the discharge of the duties which I shall be called upon to perform" "I appear before you, fellow-citizens, to take the oaths which the Constitution "I fear that a strict examination of the annals of some of the modern elective governments would develop similar instances of violated confidence" "I too well understand the dangerous temptations to which I shall be exposed," he writes "I do not place my chief confidence upon the aid of that Almighty Power," he adds The majority of our citizens, on the contrary, possess a sovereignty with an amount of power precisely equal to that which has been granted to them by the parties to the national compact, and nothing beyond We admit of no government by divine There are certain rights possessed by each individual American citizen which in his compact with the others he has never surrendered Some of them, indeed, he is unable to surrender, being, in the language of our system, unalienable The power of our sovereignty can interfere with no one's faith, prescribe forms of worship, inflict no punishment but after well-ascertained guilt The American citizen derives from no charter granted by his fellow-man He claims them Enough has been given to accomplish all the objects for which it was created It has been found powerful in war, and hitherto justice has been administered, and intimate union effected 'Great danger to our institutions does not appear to be in a usurpation by the Government of power not granted by the people,' he said When the Constitution of the United States first came from the hands of the Convention which formed it, many of the sternest republicans of the day were alarmed at the extent of the power which had been granted to the Federal Government "I conceive it strictly proper that I should take this occasion to repeat the assurances I have heretofore given of my determination to arrest the progress of that tendency if it really exists" The error of the sages who framed the Constitution may have been the source and the bitter fruits which we are still to gather from it if it continues to disfigure our system Nothing can be more corrupting, nothing more destructive of Rep John McCain renews his pledge not to run for a second term McCain: "I give my aid to it by renewing the pledge heretofore given that under no circumstances will I consent to serve another term" The President is not a part of the legislative power of the US Congress The President's power to recommend is a privilege he holds in common with every other citizen The Executive can annul the acts of the legislative body by refusing to them his assent A similar power has necessarily resulted from that instrument to the judiciary, and yet the judiciary forms no part of the Legislature The principle does not appear to have enjoyed much favor in the State governments It existed but in two, and in one of these there was a plural executive forbearance and in the spirit which was intended by its authors "It is preposterous to suppose that a thought could for a moment have been entertained that the President, placed at the capital, in the center of the country, could better understand the wants and wishes of the people" If bills were never returned to Congress by either of the Presidents referred to upon the ground of their being inexpedient or not as well adapted as they might be to the wants of the people The veto was applied upon that of It was impossible to expect that bodies so constituted should not sometimes be controlled by local interests and sectional feelings It was proper, therefore, to provide some umpire from whose situation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom might be expected "I consider the veto power, therefore, given by the Constitution to the Executive of the United States solely as a conservative power, to be used only first, to protect the Constitution from violation" Half a century has elapsed since the adoption of the present form of government It would be an object more highly desirable than the gratification of the curiosity of speculative statesmen if its precise situation could be ascertained "The great dread of the former seems to have been that the reserved powers of the States would be absorbed by those of the Federal Government" "Without denying that the result to which they looked with so much apprehension is in the way of The character of that Government, if not its designation, will be essentially and radically changed The framers of the Constitution do not appear to have anticipated at how short a period it would become a formidable instrument Presidential department has become dangerous by use of power to bring under its control the whole revenues of the country If the opinion of the most approved writers upon that species of mixed government which in modern Europe is termed 'monarchy' in The President's control over the officers who have the custody of the public money does, for all mischievous purposes at least, virtually subject the treasure also to his disposal The first Roman Emperor, in his attempt to seize the sacred "I know the importance which has been attached by men of great abilities and patriotism to the divorce, as it is called, of the Treasury from the banking institutions" "I propose to apply all the remedies which may be at my command The influence of the Executive in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise through the medium of the public officers can be effectually checked by renewing the prohibition published by Mr Jefferson attending such removal to both Houses of Congress Gold shackles, by whomsoever or by whatever pretense imposed, are as fatal to it as the iron bonds of despotism A decent and manly examination of the acts of the Government should be not only tolerated, but Some of our best political maxims and opinions have been drawn from our parent isle Others cannot be introduced in our system without singular incongruity and the production of much mischief, and this I conceive to be one The Senate, in relation to revenue bills, have the right to propose amendments, and so has the Executive The delicate duty of devising schemes of revenue should be left where the Constitution has placed it If there is one measure better calculated than another to produce that state of things by which the rich are daily adding to their hoards and the poor sinking deeper into penury, it is an exclusive metallic currency If there is a The Territories of the United States are deprived of many important political privileges without any inspiring hope as to the future The only consolation under circumstances of such deprivation is that of the devoted exterior guards of a camp The people of DC are not the subjects of the people of the States, but free American citizens No words used in the Constitution could have been intended to deprive them of that character The grant to Congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the District of Columbia can be interpreted as meaning nothing more than to allow to Congress the controlling power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of the functions assigned to the General Government by the Constitution No nation can long exist without the careful culture of those feelings of confidence and affection which are the effective bonds to union between free and confederated states The citizens of each State unite in their persons all the privileges which that character confers and all that they may claim as citizens of the United States The lines, too, separating powers to be exercised by the citizens of one State from Organized associations of citizens requiring compliance with their wishes too much resemble the 'recommendations' of Athens to her allies It was, indeed, to the ambition of the leading States of Greece to control the domestic concerns of the others Our Confederacy is perfectly illustrated by the terms and principles governing a common copartnership There is a fund of power to be exercised under the direction of the joint councils of the allied members, but that

bitterness, alienation, discord, and injury to the very "It does not become us to disparage the States governments, nor to discourage them from making proper efforts for their own relief," he said "It is our duty to encourage them to the extent of our constitutional authority to apply their The spirit of liberty is the sovereign balm for every injury which our institutions may receive No care that can be used in the construction of our Government, no division of powers, will prove effectual to keep us a free people if The love of power is a dominant passion of the human bosom The liberties of a people depend on their own constant attention to its preservation The danger to all well-established free governments arises from the unwillingness of the people to believe There is, on the contrary, no instance on record of an extensive and well-established republic being changed into an aristocracy The tendencies of all such governments in their decline is to monarchy, and the antagonist principle to liberty there is the The true spirit of liberty, although devoted, persevering, bold, and uncompromising in principle, that secured is mild and tolerant and scrupulous as to the means it

the spirit by which those parties are at this time governed must be greatly mitigated, if not entirely extinguished, or consequences will ensue which are appalling to be thought of" The spirit of liberty had fled, and, avoiding the abodes of the whole mass of citizens, the Commonwealth had none Yet the senate continued to meet in the temple of liberty to talk of the sacredness and beauty of

Presidential inauguration is a time-honored custom that marks the commencement of a new term of the Presidential office Obama: "It seemed to me fitting that I should fully make known my sentiments in regard to several of the important questions "I wish now, when every motive for misrepresentation has passed away, to repeat what was said before the election, trusting that my countrymen will candidly weigh and understand it, and that they will feel assured" Many of the calamitous efforts of the tremendous revolution which has passed over the Southern States still remain Immeasurable benefits which will surely follow, sooner or later, the hearty and generous acceptance of the legitimate results of that revolution have It must be a government which guards the interests of both races carefully and equally All so-called party interests lose their apparent importance, and party lines fade into insignificance The question of whether the US will return to barbarism is a question in which every citizen of the nation is deeply interested The emancipation of 4,000,000 people from a condition of servitude to that of "The evils which afflict the Southern States can only be removed or remedied by the united and harmonious efforts of both races" "I am sincerely anxious to use every legitimate influence in favor of honest and efficient local 'self'- The South needs and deserves the considerate care of the National Government within the just limits prescribed by the Constitution and wise public economy Universal suffrage should rest upon universal education "I ask the attention of the public to the paramount necessity of reform in our civil service," he said "A reform that shall be thorough, radical, and complete," he added Both political parties virtually pledged to give it their unreserved support The President of the United States of necessity owes his secure in his tenure as long as his personal character remained untarnished and the performance of his duties satisfactory Presidential office should be limited to six years, he writes The depression that began in September, 1873, still continues, he says The only safe paper currency is one which rests upon a coin basis and is at all times and promptly convertible into coin I adhere to the views heretofore expressed by me in favor of Congressional legislation in behalf of an early resumption President Grant's policy of submitting to arbitration grave questions in dispute between ourselves and foreign powers points to a new instrumentality for the preservation of peace noninterference in the affairs of foreign nations has proved of great value in past times and For the first time in the history of the country it has been deemed best, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case, that the objections and questions in dispute with reference to the counting of the electoral votes should be referred to a opinion will widely vary as to the wisdom of the several conclusions announced by that tribunal Human judgment is never unerring, and is rarely regarded as otherwise than wrong by the unsuccessful party in the contest The fact that two great political "I call upon you, Senators, Representatives, judges, fellow-citizens, here and everywhere, to unite with me in an earnest effort to secure to our country the blessings, not only of material prosperity, but of justice, peace

In early times, men of reflection were less apprehensive of danger from the formidable power of fleets and armies they must determine to resist than from those contests and dissensions which would certainly arise concerning the forms of government to be instituted The zeal and ardor of the people during the Revolutionary war, supplying the place of government, commanded a degree of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society Negligence of its regulations, inattention to its recommendations Jealousies and rivalries of States, decline of navigation and commerce, discouragement of necessary manufactures, universal fall in the value of lands and their produce, contempt of public and private faith, loss of consideration and credit with foreign nations I read it with great satisfaction, as the result of good heads prompted by good hearts, as an experiment better adapted to the genius, character, situation, and relations of this nation and country than any which had ever been proposed or suggested I have repeatedly laid myself under the most serious obligations to support the Constitution I have acquired an habitual attachment to it and veneration for it What other form of government, indeed, can so well deserve our esteem and love?

It is now three days more than a hundred years since the adoption of the first written constitution of the United States The new Republic was then beset with danger on every hand The decisive battle of the war for independence had not yet "We cannot overestimate the fervent love of liberty, the intelligent courage, and the sum of common sense with which our fathers made the great experiment of self-government" "Under this Constitution the boundaries of freedom have been enlarged, Under this Constitution twenty-five States have been added to the Union, with constitutions and laws, framed and enforced by their own citizens The jurisdiction of this Constitution now covers an area fifty times greater than that of the original thirteen States "The supremacy of the nation and its laws should be no longer a subject of debate," he said "The discussion, which for half a century threatened the existence of the Union, was closed at last in the high court of war The elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship is the most important political change we have known since the adoption of the Constitution of 1787 It has freed us from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution It The emancipated race has already made and enfeebled both It has surrendered to their own guardianship the manhood of more than 5,000,000 people, and has opened to each one of them a career of They are rapidly laying the material foundations of self-support, widening their circle of intelligence, and beginning to enjoy the blessings that gather around the homes of the industrious poor So far as my authority can lawfully extend they shall enjoy the Bad local government is certainly a great evil, which ought to be prevented But to violate the freedom and sanctities of the suffrage is more than an evil It is a crime which, if persisted in, will destroy the Government Voters of the Union make and unmake constitutions, and upon whose will hang the destinies of our governments If that generation comes to its inheritance blinded by ignorance and corrupted by vice, the fall of the Republic will be North and South alike there is but one remedy upon the South alone It is the high privilege and sacred duty of those now living to educate their successors and fit them, by intelligence and virtue, for the inheritance which awaits them "We may hasten or we may retard, but we cannot prevent, the final reconciliation," he writes "Let all our people, leaving behind them the battlefields of dead issues, move forward" Gold and silver afford the only safe foundation for a monetary system Congress should provide that the compulsory coinage of silver now required by law may not disturb our monetary system by driving either metal out of circulation Grave doubts have been entertained whether Congress is authorized by the Constitution to make any form of paper money legal tender Such paper should depend for its value and currency upon its convenience in use and its prompt redemption in coin at the will of Farms of the United States afford homes and employment for more than one-half our people As the Government lights our coasts for the protection of mariners and the benefit of commerce, so it should give to the tillers of the US should construct ship canals or railways across the isthmus which unites the continents No plans have been sufficiently matured to warrant the United States in extending pecuniary aid The Mormon Church not only offends the moral sense of manhood by sanctioning polygamy, but prevents the administration of justice through ordinary instrumentalities of law It is the duty of Congress to prohibit within its jurisdiction all criminal practices "I shall at the proper time ask Congress to fix the tenure of the minor offices of the several Executive Departments and prescribe the grounds upon which removals shall be made," Obama writes "I appeal to you for that earnest and thoughtful support which makes this Government in fact, as it is in law, a government of the people" "I shall greatly rely upon the wisdom and patriotism of Congress and of those who may
The four years which have elapsed since last I stood in this place have been crowded with counsel and action of the most vital interest and consequence Perhaps no equal period in our history has been so fruitful of important reforms in our economic and industrial "It has been hard to preserve calm counsel while the thought of our own people swayed this way and that under their influence" "We are a composite and cosmopolitan people We are of the blood of all the nations that are at war Despite many divisions, we have drawn closer together We have been deeply wronged upon the seas, but we have not wished to wrong or injure in return It is in this spirit and with this thought that we have grown more and We stand firm in armed neutrality since it seems that in no other way we can demonstrate what it is we insist upon and cannot forget We may even be drawn on, by circumstances, not by our own purpose or desire, to a "We realize that the greatest things that remain to be done must be done with the whole world for stage and in cooperation with the wide and universal forces of mankind" "We are making our spirits ready for those things" "The essential principle of peace is the actual equality of nations in all matters of right or privilege" "The seas should be equally free and safe for the use of all peoples, under rules set up by common agreement and consent" " "I stand here and have taken the high and solemn oath to which you have been audience because the people of the United States" "I need not argue these principles to you, my fellow countrymen; they are your own part and "I pray God I may be given the wisdom and the prudence to do my duty in the true spirit of this great people" "I know now what the task means I realize to the full the responsibility which it involves" " "The shadows that now lie dark upon our path will soon be dispelled," he writes "We shall walk with the light all about us if we be but true to ourselves"
President Bush: "I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live" President Clinton: "We have seen our vulnerability, and we have seen its deepest source" America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of freedom in other lands The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of free freedom in all the The US seeks and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, Obama says The goal is to end tyranny in our world, he says My most solemn duty is to protect this Nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats Some have unwisely chosen to test America's resolve and have found it firm We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty, though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt Americans, of all people, should never Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: "Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not The president says the US has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon "Tens of millions have achieved their freedom," he says "As hope kindles hope, millions more will President Barack Obama asks young Americans to believe in their country Obama: America has need of idealism and courage because we have essential work at home The president says he wants to give every American a stake in the promise and future of the country He wants to widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings, and health insurance, preparing people for the challenges of life Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before In America's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service and mercy President Obama: Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth are bound to one another in the cause of freedom Obama: We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward Liberty is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitants thereof Renewed in our strength

There is no constitutional or legal requirement that the President shall take the oath of office in the presence of the people But there is so manifest an appropriateness in the public induction to office of the chief executive officer of the nation that First inauguration of President Washington took place in New York, where Congress was then sitting, on the 30th day of April, 1789 "Our people have already worthily observed the centennials of the Declaration of Independence, of the battle of Yorktown, and of the adoption of the Constitution," he said "When the centennial of the institution

patriotism have given recent proof of their continued presence The commercial policy of the mother country had not relaxed any of its hard and oppressive features Petitions poured in upon Congress

hopefully to the continuance of our protective system," he said "The men who have invested their capital in these enterprises will not fail to find and to defend a community of interest" I do not

the suggestion of a special The duty to obey and to execute embraces the Constitution in its entirety and the whole code of laws enacted under it The evil example of permitting individuals, corporations, or communities to nullify the laws because they cross some selfish or local interest The evil works from a bad center both ways It demoralizes those who practice it and destroys the faith of those who suffer by it in the efficiency of the law An unlawful expedient cannot become a permanent condition of government Law is the rule of conduct and where courts, not mobs, execute its penalties is the only attractive field for business investments and honest labor Our naturalization laws should be so amended as to make the inquiry into the character and good We have happily maintained a policy of avoiding all interference with European affairs We have a just right to expect that our European policy will be the American policy of European courts We should not cease to be

renounced his allegiance The sympathy and help of our people will not be withheld from any community struggling with special embarrassments or difficulties connected with the suff Party success

On each national day of Inauguration since 1789, the people have renewed their sense of dedication to the United States To us there has come a time, in the midst of swift happenings, to pause for a moment and "We were in the midst of shockùbut we acted We acted quickly, boldly, decisively" "These later years have been living yearsùfruitful years for the people of this democracy" "I hope, I Prophets of the downfall of American democracy have seen their dire predictions come to naught action has been taken within the three-way framework of the Constitution of the United States The coordinate branches of the Government continue freely to function A Nation, like a person, has a body that must be fed and clothed and housed, invigorated and rested, in a manner that measures up to the standards of our time A Nation has something deeper, something more permanent The democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase in human history It permeated the ancient life of early peoples It blazed anew in the Middle Ages In the Americas its impact has been irresistible "The hopes of the Republic cannot forever tolerate either undeserved poverty or self-serving wealth" "If the spirit of America were killed, even though the Nation's body and mind, constricted in an alien world, lived on, "The destiny of America was proclaimed in words of prophecy spoken by our first President in his first Inaugural in 1789" "The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly "Our strong purpose is to protect and to perpetuate the integrity of democracy" "We muster the spirit of America, and the faith of America We do not retreat We are not content to stand still"

"I assume the arduous and responsible duties of President of the United States" "I invoke the guidance of Almighty God" "The country is suffering from industrial disturbances" Our currency should continue under the supervision of the Government The several forms of our paper money offer, in my judgment, a constant embarrassment to the Government and a safe balance in the Treasury Congress must be both "sure we are right" and "make haste slowly" amended without investigation and demonstration of the wisdom of the proposed changes If such power is vested in the President, it is my purpose to appoint a commission of The US experiment is, at all events, worth a trial, and, in my opinion, it can but prove beneficial to the entire country The credit of the Government, the integrity of its currency, and the inv severest economy must be observed in all public expenditures, and extravagance stopped wherever it is found, and prevented wherever in the future it may be developed The Government should not be permitted to run behind or increase its debt in times A deficiency is inevitable so long as the expenditures of the Government exceed its receipts It can only be met by loans or an increased revenue A large annual surplus of revenue may invite waste and extravagance, inadequate revenue creates distrust The best way for the Government to maintain its credit is to pay as it goes The country is clearly opposed to any needless additions to the subject of internal taxation Ultimately pay, while its ability to pay is not strengthened, but weakened The controlling principle in the raising of revenue from duties on imports is zealous care for American interests and American labor The people have declared that such legislation should be had as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and the development of Congress' paramount duty is to stop deficiencies by restoring protective legislation The passage of such a law or laws would strengthen the credit of the Government both at home and abroad The depression of the past four years has fallen with especial severity upon the great body of toilers of the country, and upon none more than the holders of small farms The revival of manufacturing will be a relief to both Business conditions are not the most promising It will take time to restore the prosperity of former years Congress will not, I am sure, be found lacking in disposition or ability to relieve it The US has advanced the cause of freedom throughout the world, and immeasurably strengthened the precious free institutions which we enjoy The people love and will sustain these institutions Law-respecting and law-abiding people, not easily swerved from path of patriotism and honor Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States Courts, not mobs, must execute the penalties The party now restored to power has been in the past that of "opposition to all combinations of capital organized in trusts, or otherwise, to control arbitrarily the condition of trade among our citizens," he writes Illiteracy must be banished from the land if we shall attain that high destiny as the foremost of the enlightened nations of the world Reforms in the civil service must go on; but the changes should be real and genuine, not Congress should give prompt attention to the restoration of our American merchant marine, once the pride of the seas in all the great ocean highways of commerce The United States has progressed with marvelous rapidity in every field of enterprise The US must provide a merchant marine amply sufficient for our own carrying trade to foreign countries It will be our aim to pursue a firm and dignified foreign policy, which shall be just, impartial, ever watchful Peace is preferable to war in almost every contingency Arbitration is the true method of settlement of international as well as local or individual differences Our diplomacy should seek nothing more and accept nothing less than is due us Treaty with Great Britain was signed at Washington and transmitted to the Senate for its ratification in January last I respectfully urge the early action of the Senate thereon, not merely as a matter of policy, but as a duty to Each President has avoided convening Congress in extraordinary session Congress alone has power to provide revenues for the Government Not to convene it under such circumstances is the neglect of a plain duty There could be no better time to put the Government upon a sound financial and economic basis than now The people have only recently voted that this should be done, and nothing is more binding upon them than the obligation of immediate action President Theodore Roosevelt wrote a letter to Congress on March 15, 1897 He urged them to act quickly to settle the issue before an election was held The North and the South no longer divide on the old lines, but upon principles and policies Let us rejoice in and cultivate this spirit; it is ennobling and will be both a gain and a blessing to our beloved country "I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution" "This is the obligation I have reverently taken before the Lord
There has been a change of government The offices of President and Vice-President have been put into the hands of Democrats What does the change mean? That is the question that is uppermost in our minds "Some new things, as we look frankly upon them, willing to comprehend their real character, have come to assume the aspect of things long believed in and familiar, stuff of our own convictions" We have squandered a great part of what we might have used, and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature We have been proud of our industrial achievements, but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count "The great Government we loved has too often been made use of for private and selfish purposes, and those who used it had forgotten the people" "We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound "We were very heedless and in a hurry to be great," he says "The scales of heedlessness have fallen from our eyes," he adds A tariff which cuts us off from our proper part in the commerce of the world, violates the just principles of taxation, and makes the Government a facile instrument in the hand of private interests A banking and currency system based upon the "We have studied as perhaps no other nation has the most effective means of production, but we have not studied cost or economy as we should either as organizers of industry, as statesmen, or as individuals" "Government may be put The first duty of law is to keep sound the society it serves Sanitary laws, pure food laws, and laws determining conditions of labor are intimate parts of the very business of justice and legal efficiency Justice, and only justice, shall always be our motto We know our task to be no mere task of politics but a task which shall search us through and through The feelings with which we face this new age of right and opportunity "I summon all honest men, all patriotic, all forward-looking men, to my side God helping me, I will not fail them, if they will but counsel and sustain me!"

Four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other The prayers of both could not be answered That of neither has been answered fully The Almighty has His own purposes "Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away," he writes "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as
Anyone who has taken the oath I have just taken must feel a heavy weight of responsibility I should be untrue to myself, to my promises, and to the declarations of the party platform upon which I was elected to office The steps which my predecessor took and the legislation passed on his recommendation have accomplished much To render the reforms lasting, however, and to secure at the same time freedom from alarm on the part of those pursuing proper and progressive business "I hope to be able to submit at the first regular session of the incoming Congress, in December next, definite suggestions in respect to the needed amendments" Congress will meet on the 15th day of March, in order that consideration may be at once given to a bill revising the Dingley Act This should secure an adequate revenue and adjust the duties in such a manner as to afford It is thought that there has been such a change in conditions since the enactment of the Dingley Act, drafted on a similarly protective principle, that the measure of the tariff above stated will permit the reduction of rates in certain schedules The The tariff is more important in the long run than the perfecting of the reforms in respect to antitrust legislation and interstate commerce regulation To secure the needed speed in the passage of the tariff bill, it would seem wise to attempt no other current fiscal year will exceed the receipts by $100,000,000 It is imperative that such a deficit shall not continue I recommend a graduated inheritance tax as correct in principle The scope of a modern government in what it can and ought to accomplish for its people has been widened far beyond the principles laid down by the old "laissez faire" school of political writers This widening has met popular approval The Panama Canal should be treated as a distinct enterprise, and should be paid for by the proceeds of bonds It may well be submitted to the serious consideration of Congress whether the deepening and control of the channel of a great river system should The cost of maintaining a proper army, a proper navy, and suitable fortifications upon the mainland of the United States and in its dependencies We should have an army so organized and so officered as to be capable in time of emergency The number of men to man them is insufficient The distance of our shores from Europe and Asia of course reduces the necessity for maintaining under arms a great army A modern navy cannot be improvised It must be built and in existence when the "I wish to reiterate all the reasons which he has presented in favor of the policy of maintaining a strong navy" "We shall enter into any war with a full consciousness of the awful consequences that it always entails, whether successful or not The US can

should fulfill promise of Republican platform and pass a proper postal savings bank bill The promise to repay by the Government will furnish an inducement to savings deposits which private enterprise cannot supply Free trade between this country and the Philippines will be marked upon our sales of cottons, agricultural machinery, and other manufactures The necessity of the establishment of direct lines of steamers between North and South America has been brought to the The Panama Canal will have a most important bearing upon the trade between the eastern and far western sections of our country The type of the canal as a lock canal was fixed by Congress after a full consideration of the conflicting reports of the majority A board of competent engineers examined the Gatun dam and locks, which are the key of the lock type The construction will go on under a most effective organization controlled by Colonel Goethals and his fellow army engineers associated with him The prosperity of Porto Rico continues unabated The business conditions in the Philippines are not all that we could wish them to be The passage of the new tariff bill permitting free trade "I look forward with hope to increasing the already good feeling between the South and the other sections of the country" "The consideration of this question cannot, however, be complete and full without reference to the negro race, its progress and The thirteenth and fourteenth amendments have been generally enforced and have secured the objects for which they are intended The tendency of Southern legislation today is toward the enactment of electoral qualifications which shall square with that amendment The danger of the control of an ignorant electorate has therefore passed The interest which many of the Southern white citizens take in the welfare of the negroes has increased The colored men must base their hope on the results of their own industry It is not the disposition or within the province of the Federal Government to interfere with the regulation by Southern States of their domestic affairs There is in the South a stronger feeling than ever among the intelligent well-to-do, and influential The negroes are now Americans Their ancestors came here years ago against their will This is their only country and their only flag They have shown themselves anxious to live for it and to die for it The Executive, in recognizing the negro race by appointments, must exercise a careful discretion not thereby to do it more harm than good We must be careful not to encourage the mere pretense of race feeling manufactured in the interest of individual political The future of the South is to be much benefited by the industrial and intellectual progress of the negro The exercise of political franchises by those of this race who are intelligent and well to do will be acquiesced in The right to vote Congress has passed a law fixing the compensation of government employees for injuries sustained in the employ of the Government through the negligence of the superior It has also passed a model child-labor law for the District of Columbia In previous administrations "My convictions are fixed," he wrote "The proposition that business is not a property or pecuniary right which can be protected by equitable injunction is utterly without foundation in precedent" The secondary boycott is an instrument of tyranny, and ought not to be made legitimate The issue of a temporary restraining order without notice has in several instances been abused by its inconsiderate exercise The American people insist that the authority of "I invoke the considerate sympathy and support of my fellow-citizens and the aid of the Almighty God in the discharge of my responsible duties," he says
President-elect Barack Obama takes the oath of office on the Bible his mother gave him just a few years ago Obama: "This inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning, a new dedication within our Government, and a new spirit among us Ours was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both spirituality and human liberty milestone in the long quest for freedom But the bold and brilliant dream which excited the founders of this Nation still awaits its consummation I believe America can be better We can be even stronger than before Let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principles of our Nation We know that if we despise our own government, we have no future "We cannot afford to do everything, nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future" "Our Nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home" "We will not behave in foreign places so as "We are a proudly idealistic nation, but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness" "Because we are free, we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere" "We do not seek to intimidate, but The world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries We pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world's armaments to those necessary for each nation's own domestic safety I would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace, based not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values These are not just my goals---and they will
President Obama: "What binds this Nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names" "What makes us exceptional--; what makes us American--; is our allegiance to an "We learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free" "We determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce, schools and colleges to train The president says the US has never relinquished its skepticism of central authority He says the American people can no more meet the demands of today's world by acting alone America's possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands must do these things together, as one nation and one people This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and We must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our Tax Code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens While the means will change, our purpose endures: a nation that rewards the effort and determination of "We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few" "We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult America cannot resist this transition, we must lead it We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the "We must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice," Obama says "Peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes," he says "Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law," he says "If we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well" President Obama: Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our time Obama: We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute The words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope
"I appear here to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution, and, in compliance with a time-honored custom, to address those who are now assembled" "I am conscious that the position which I have been called to fill "I hope to execute diligently, impartially, and for the best interests of the country the manifold duties devolved upon me" "My guide will be the Constitution, which I this day swear to "preserve, protect, and "I this day renew the declarations I have heretofore made and proclaim my fixed determination to maintain to the extent of my ability the Government in its original purity" Military and naval schools, sustained by the liberality of Congress, shall receive the special attention of the Executive We are warned by the admonitions of history and the voice of our own beloved Washington to abstain from entangling alliances with "I shall make honesty, capacity, and fidelity indispensable prerequisites to the bestowal of office" "The absence of either of these qualities shall be deemed sufficient cause for removal" "I shall be my study to recommend such constitutional "I will zealously unite with the coordinate branches of the Government," he said "I congratulate you, my friend," he added "Let us invoke a continuance of the same protecting care which has led us from small beginnings to the eminence we this day occupy" "Let us seek to deserve that continuance by prudence and moderation in our councils" "
"I have been called a second time to act as Executive over this great nation" "It is my firm conviction that the civilized world is tending toward republicanism, or government" Under our Republic we support an army less than that of any European power of any standing The theory of government changes with general progress The effects of the late civil strife have been to free the slave Social equality is not a subject to be legislated upon, nor shall I ask that anything be done to advance the social status of the colored man citizenship should carry with it This is wrong, and should be corrected "I do not share in the apprehension held by many as to the danger of governments becoming weakened and destroyed by reason of their extension of territory" "I believe that our Great Maker is preparing the world, in His own good time, "It is either this or war of war of the United States of America," he writes He calls for the restoration of our currency to a fixed value as compared with the world's standard of values War of extermination, engaged in by people pursuing commerce and all industrial pursuits, are expensive even against the weakest people, and are demoralizing and wicked Our superiority of strength and advantages of civilization should make us lenient toward the Indian "I acknowledge before this assemblage, representing, as it does, every section of our country, the obligation I am under to my countrymen," he said "I performed a conscientious duty, without asking promotion or command, and without a revengeful feeling toward any section or individual" "I have been the subject of abuse and slander scarcely ever equaled in political history"
"No people on earth have more cause to be thankful than ours," he writes "We are the heirs of the ages, and yet we have had to pay few of the penalties which in old countries are exacted by the dead "We have duties to others and duties to ourselves; and we can shirk neither" "We must behave as beseems a people with such responsibilities" "Justice and generosity in a nation, as in an individual, count most No weak nation that acts manfully and justly should ever have cause to fear us No strong power should ever be able to single us out as a subject for insolent aggression Power invariably means both responsibility and danger Never before have men tried so vast and formidable an experiment as that of administering the affairs of a continent under the forms of a Democratic republic If we fail, the cause of free self-government throughout the world will rock to its foundations There is no good reason why we should fear the future, but there is every reason to face it seriously We know that self-government is difficult, but we have faith that we shall not prove false to the memories of the men "We must show, not merely in great crises, but in the everyday affairs of life, the qualities of practical intelligence, of courage, of hardihood, and endurance, and above all the power of devotion to a lofty ideal
Presidential oath is taken during times of prosperity and still waters of peace America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our fore Homes have been lost, jobs shed, businesses shuttered Our health care is too costly Our schools fail too many These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics The time has come to set aside childish things and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics In reaffirming the greatness of our Nation, we understand that "For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life," Obama says "They toiled in sweatshops and settled the West, endured the lash of the whip, and plowed "We must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America," Obama says "The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act," he says The question we ask today is not whether our Government is too big or too small, but whether it works Whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified Where the President Obama: America cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous Obama: We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals "America is a nation that expands freedom is unmatched" "We are ready to lead once more," Obama says "We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan" America is a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth America must play its role in ushering in a new era of "We pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow" "Your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy" "We can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders The fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages They embody the spirit of service, a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves At this moment, a moment that will define a generation, it is precisely this spirit The values upon which our success depends are old and true, he says What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility, he writes "Let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled," he says "America, in the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words," "When we were tested, we refused to let this journey end," he said "We carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations"
President Theodore Roosevelt addressed the nation in 1897 He said the US had a surplus instead of a deficit at the time Today, the country has a surplus of $41,000,000 The national verdict of 1896 has for the most part been executed Whatever remains unfulfilled is a continuing obligation resting with undiminished force upon the Executive and Congress "I did all that in honor could be done to avert the war, but without avail," he said "The Congress at its first regular session, without party division, provided money in anticipation of the crisis" "I enter upon its administration appreciating the great responsibilities which attach to this renewed honor and commission" "I would shrink from the duties this day assumed if I did not feel that in their performance I should have the co-operation of Sectionalism has disappeared, and division on public questions can no longer be traced by the war maps of 1861 Existing problems demand the thought and quicken the conscience of the country The responsibility for their presence, as well The prophets of evil were not the builders of the Republic, nor in its crises since have they saved or served it The faith of the fathers was a mighty force in its creation, and the faith of their descendants has wrought its progress "We must not be disheartened, but the more earnestly dedicate ourselves to the task upon which we have rightly entered" "The path of progress is seldom smooth" "We are undergoing the same ordeal as did our predecessors nearly The US has had 125 years of achievement for mankind We will not surrender our equality with other powers on matters fundamental and essential to nationality We adhere to the principle of equality among ourselves US policy will be that of moderation and fairness With our near neighbors we must remain close friends The transfer of American control to the new government is of such great importance The principles which led to our intervention require that the fundamental law upon which the new government rests should be adapted to secure a government capable of performing the duties and discharging the functions of a separate nation The peace which we are pledged to Congress has indicated no form of government for the Philippine Islands It has, however, provided an army to enable the Executive to suppress insurrection, restore peace, give security to the inhabitants The Congress has added the sanction of its authority to the powers already possessed and exercised by the Executive under the Constitution I shall continue the efforts already begun until order shall be restored throughout the islands As fast as conditions permit will establish local The most liberal terms of amnesty have already been communicated to the insurgents, and the way is still open for those who have raised their arms against the Government We are not waging war against the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands A portion of them The US will not leave the destiny of the loyal millions the islands to the disloyal thousands who are in rebellion against the United States Order Force will not be needed or used when those who make war against us shall make
"I am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow," Obama says "We affirm old traditions and make new beginnings," he says America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations It is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity America has never been united by blood or birth or soil We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests America at its best matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment; it is the choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent We will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans America remains engaged in the world "America at its best is compassionate," Obama says "We will speak for the values that gave our Nation birth," he adds President Barack Obama: "America at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected" Obama: We find the fullness of life not only in options but in commitments "Children and community are the commitments that set us I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to serve the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times Thomas Jefferson wrote: "An angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm" Jefferson: "We renew that purpose today, to make our country more just and generous" God directs this storm God bless you all, and God bless America
I accept with humility the honor which the American people have conferred upon me I accept it with a resolve to do all that I can for the welfare of this Nation and for the peace of the world I ask for your encouragement and for "The supreme need of our time is for men to learn to live together in peace and harmony" "The American people stand firm in the faith which has inspired this Nation from the beginning" "From this faith we will not be moved The US desire, and are determined to work for, a world in which all nations and all peoples are free to govern themselves as they see fit, and to achieve a decent and satisfying life In pursuit of these aims Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity, as well as the inalienable right, to govern himself with reason and justice Communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause, punishment without trial, The US has invested its substance and its energy in a great constructive effort to restore peace, stability, and freedom to the world We have sought no territory We have imposed our will on none We have asked for no privileges We have encouraged, by precept and example, the expansion of world trade on a sound and fair basis settlement of disputes among nations We have made every effort to secure agreement on effective international control of our most powerful weapon "We are moving on with other nations to build an even stronger structure of international order and justice" "We are ready to undertake new projects to strengthen a free world" "The initiative is ours" We are confident of the success of this major venture in world recovery We believe that our partners in this effort will achieve the status of self-supporting nations once again We must carry out our plans for reducing the barriers to world Every country participating in these arrangements must contribute all it can to the common defense If we can make it sufficiently clear, in advance, that any armed attack affecting our national security would be met with overwhelming force, the armed attack might never occur The United States is pre-eminent among nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques We should make available to peace-loving peoples the benefits of our store of technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations This should be a cooperative enterprise in which all nations work together through the United Nations The old imperialism--exploitation for foreign profit--has no place in our plans All countries, including our own, will greatly benefit from a "Greater production is the key to prosperity and peace," he says "Only by helping the least fortunate of its members to help themselves can the human family achieve the decent, satisfying life" "Democracy alone can supply the vital We are weaving a world fabric of international security and growing prosperity prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves strong We are aided by all who wish to live in freedom from fear "What we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass in greater liberty," he says "We will advance toward a world where man's freedom is secure," he adds
